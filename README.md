# Katerina Photos Custom JS
The custom JS, front-end and back-end, for the Katerina Photos (https://www.katarina.photos/) website made for the 2021 FBLA Web Design competition.

`book.js` contains the front-end custom Velo code for the Book page, which allows for free/busy-schedule-based booking form date/time validation and sends the submitted form data to the backend. `http-functions.js` contains the back-end custom Velo code for the REST API (HTTP Function), which sends the booking form submission confirmation email and creates a new Google Calendar event with the given details.
